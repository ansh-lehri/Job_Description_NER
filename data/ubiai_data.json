Prepare aptitude and reasoning (This will come in the first round of your test) Prepare your coding (I would recommend you to select either python or java) Why python?

It\u2019s always better to become industry-ready beforehand. What to do after the clearance of your written round? Prepare your resume. Work on your spoken skills (Try to practice in front of the mirror or record your videos while answering certain questions and then share those videos or audios to your friends and teachers -so, that they can correct you beforehand. Prepare certain questions like: Tell me something about yourself? What do you know about our company? (That should include Founder details, Number of employees, and Revenue) Can you explain your project?

Prepare aptitude and reasoning (This will come in the first round of your test) Prepare your coding (I would recommend you to select either python or java) Why python?

It\u2019s always better to become industry-ready beforehand. What to do after the clearance of your written round? Prepare your resume. Work on your spoken skills (Try to practice in front of the mirror or record your videos while answering certain questions and then share those videos or audios to your friends and teachers -so, that they can correct you beforehand. Prepare certain questions like: Tell me something about yourself? What do you know about our company? (That should include Founder details, Number of employees, and Revenue) Can you explain your project? (They will ask cross-questions) Your strengths and hobbies Any Questions (This is a tricky question, try to make most of it.)

Prepare aptitude and reasoning (This will come in the first round of your test) Prepare your coding (I would recommend you to select either python or java) Why python?

Prepare certain questions like: Tell me something about yourself? What do you know about our company?

Who is the founder of our company? Where is our headquarter? Will you be able to reallocate? Would you be able to work during night shifts for our international clients? Will you be able to work under pressure? What is your strength? (example: work under pressure, agility, etc.) Which is your preferred location and why? Do you have any questions? (tip: If they asked you this question, then you can ask them the following questions) Does your company conducts hackathons for their employees (Since I am good at management, coding. Try to impress them) If I get selected for this role, is there any way to move upward in the hierarchy? Be polite all the time.
